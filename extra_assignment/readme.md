Question1. Navigate Reddit.com and find sub-reddits that are related to community issues either in Washington D.C. or Fairfax, VA (you can focus only on one of the cities or both). After finding several sub-reddits that are relevant, list the sub-reddit URLs that you found in the “README.md” file

The  url that consist of controversial data
https://www.reddit.com/r/washingtondc/hot/

Question2. Collect more than 500 postings from the sub-reddits using any tools or languages. Save the data in any format under the “data” folder. If you wrote any scripts, you need to save the file in the assignment folder. If you didn’t write any scripts but used a software tool to collect data, you need to write down the process in detail in the “README.md” file .

The Name of the Script to extarct the data is :extra_01230629.ipynb

 
Question3. Process and clean the data and save it as the “CSV” format. This cleaned data needs to present all the meta data such as (1) the date/time of the posting, (2) the user name of the composer, (3) the number of comments, (4) actual posting contents, (5) the number of likes/dislikes/points, (6) the URL of the image (if any), (7) the number of shares, and (8) the sub-reddit URL.

The cleaned csv file is stored in the data folder in extra assignment 

Question4.Extract features from the data (if any) and provide descriptive statistics of the data using any tables and visualizations. These descriptive statistics need to be presented either on the “README.md” file or a separate report in “.html” or “.pdf” format. Save the descriptive statistics results in the same assignment folder .

Refer the descriptive_01230629_jupyter notebook.pdf file to analyse the data 

Question5.Conduct further data analysis beyond the descriptive analysis. You can come up with any analysis methods and strategies. Some examples could include, but are not limited to, (1) NLP-based sentiment analysis, (2) hypothesis testing using statistical models, (3) machine learning to predict some features, (4) geo-spatial analysis to map each posting on neighborhood, or (5) implementation of a filtering algorithm that selects a particular type of postings out of the data. Report the analysis
